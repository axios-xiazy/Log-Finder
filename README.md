# Enhanced Garena Account Checker - DataDome Bypass Improvements

## Overview
This document details the comprehensive enhancements made to the Garena account checker to significantly improve DataDome bypass capabilities, targeting a success rate increase from the original baseline to **95%+**.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Enhanced Browser Fingerprint Generation

#### Real Chrome Version Distribution
- **Before**: Used 5 basic Chrome versions
- **After**: Implemented 15 real Chrome versions with accurate market share distribution
- **Impact**: Reduces detection by using only commonly used browser versions

Real version distribution:
```python
("120.0.6099.129", 0.18),
("119.0.6045.199", 0.15),
("121.0.6167.85", 0.12),
# ... and 12 more authentic versions
```

#### Improved Screen Resolution Management
- **Before**: Fixed screen configurations
- **After**: Dynamic screen configs with realistic variations
- **Features**:
  - Color depth variation (24/30 bit)
  - Accurate taskbar/dock heights
  - Minimal coordinate variations (-10 to +10 pixels)
  - 8 real-world screen configurations

### 2. Advanced Challenge Solving Algorithms

#### Multiple Solver Strategies
Added **7 different solving methods**:

1. **Proof-of-Work Challenge Solver**
   - Sequential search optimization
   - Random search algorithm  
   - Parallel multi-threading approach
   - Timestamp-based starting points

2. **Advanced Cryptographic Solver**
   - Base64 decoding capabilities
   - Multiple hash algorithms (SHA256, SHA1, MD5, SHA384, SHA512)
   - XOR-based solution patterns

3. **Timing-Based Challenge Solver**
   - Human-like thinking delays (0.8-1.5x variation)
   - Difficulty-proportional timing
   - Capped at 3 seconds for efficiency

4. **Behavioral Challenge Solver**
   - Mouse movement signature generation
   - Keyboard typing patterns
   - Scrolling behavior simulation

### 3. Enhanced HTTP/2 and TLS Fingerprinting

#### Advanced Browser Impersonation
- **Before**: Basic browser selection
- **After**: Granular Chrome version detection
  - Chrome 119, 120, 121 support
  - Automatic version selection from user agent
  - HTTP/2 protocol support enabled
  - SSL verification maintained

#### Comprehensive Header Management
Added modern browser headers:
```python
"Sec-Ch-Ua-Arch": '"x86"',
"Sec-Ch-Ua-Bitness": '"64"',
"Sec-Ch-Ua-Wow64": "?0",
"Sec-CH-Prefers-Reduced-Motion": "no-preference",
"Sec-CH-UA-Form-Factors": '"Desktop"'
```

Conditional headers for realism:
- "Purpose" and "X-Purpose" added 20% of time
- "Upgrade" in Connection header randomly

### 4. Adaptive Retry Mechanisms

#### Intelligent Backoff Strategy
- **Fixed exponential backoff** → **Pattern-based adaptive delays**
- Classifies failures into categories:
  - `403 errors` → Aggressive regeneration
  - `challenge_failed` → Moderate regeneration  
  - `unknown` → Standard regeneration

#### Three-Tier Session Regeneration

**Aggressive (403 errors):**
- Complete fingerprint regeneration
- New HTTP client
- Behavioral simulator reset
- 2-5 second new session delay

**Moderate (challenge failures):**
- Fingerprint preservation
- Session ID updates
- New DataDome cookie
- 1-2 second delay

**Standard (other failures):**
- Session ID update only
- Minimal 0.5-1 second delay

### 5. Enhanced Human Behavior Simulation

#### Realistic Form Interaction
Added comprehensive human behavior patterns:

**Username Typing:**
- First character slower (0.1-0.25s)
- Occasional pauses every 3 characters (0.15-0.3s)
- Normal speed between (0.06-0.18s)

**Password Typing:**
- Faster, more erratic timing (0.04-0.12s)
- 5% chance of typo simulation with backspace
- Mistake correction delays

**Submission Behavior:**
- 30% hesitation before clicking
- 70% use Tab field navigation, 30% use mouse
- 50% Enter key submit, 50% mouse click
- Post-submission validation glances (40% chance)

#### Target-Aware Mouse Movements
- Specific coordinate ranges for form elements
- Username field: (450-750, 320-360)
- Password field: (450-750, 370-410)  
- Submit button: (550-650, 470-520)
- Smooth curved paths with step interpolation

### 6. Enhanced Session Management

#### Dynamic DataDome Cookie Generation
- Version variation based on Chrome version
- Tag randomization ("4.2.0", "4.1.9", "4.2.1")
- Timestamp jitter (±1000ms)
- Conditional is_d/as_d flags based on probability
- WebGL capability detection

#### Cookie Rotation Strategy
- Multiple fallback cookies on challenge failure
- Persistent behavioral hash generation
- Automatic cookie refresh on session regeneration

## Performance Improvements
